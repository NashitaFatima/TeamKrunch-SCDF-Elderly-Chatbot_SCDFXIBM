## Short Description of the problem
**Problem:** 
How to make use of analytics from data collected to evaluate emergency situations regarding the elderly, in order to alert Community First Responders to attend to the situation.

**How technology can help?:** 
Optimise manpower and meet the needs of the elderly.

**Proposed idea:** 
Chatbot that the elderly/ elderly caregiver may use to assess their situation and gain appropriate feedback. They will be prompted to call for CFR should the need arise. Chatbot will analyse the data imputed by the user, compare it with the existing database to assess the situation, and provide appropriate feedback.
